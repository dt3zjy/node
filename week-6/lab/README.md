# Lab 5: Google's AI-Powered App

### Goal

We will be exploring Google's debut app that can diagnose skin conditions based on photos of the consumer's skin. It's fairly new and could potentially help a bunch of people that could be walking around with harmful skin conditions. This example of a real world use of a ML classification model highlights the ways certain companies are utilizing machine learning.

### Your Task

After reading the article and by **using your knowledge of how machine learning models are trained**, tackle the following questions under a group discussion:

1. If you were at Google, what kind of data would you need to train the model?
2. How would you validate the model? Be specific - how big would the project be, who would you need to recruit, etc.?
3. What might be some problems of a dataset with the following pictures (besides not enough data)?

4. How could we prevent the problem(s) of a dataset similar to the one above? Hint: It's not *just* about the training data
