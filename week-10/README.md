# Week 9: Show and Tell!
 
Congrats on making it all the way through! We hope y'all learned something cool the last few weeks.

### What we learned

We've learned quite a lot this semester. 

We started off with the basics of working with data in Python, learning how to manipulate columns and observations. We moved on to more advanced topics, learning to clean messy data, or get it into the formats we needed. After that, we jumped into building visualizations, and made them useful for exploring trends through interactivity. 

Halfway through the semester, we took an aside to talk about GitHub, and how to share our code through Git. Shortly after, we stepped into machine learning, building up the human intuition behind models, seeing some behind-the-scenes of several algorithms, and capping off with a runthrough of classification metrics.

All the content will live on in some format at [github.com/dt3zjy/node](https://github.com/dt3zjy/node), if not at this website.

### What's next?

There's so many places to go from here. 

- Continue your journey here at Forge!
- Take some UVA classes! The instructors would be more than happy to suggest Stat, CS, and DS courses for all majors & skill levels
- Make something cool! Pick a new dataset, refine a project from class, there's no wrong expeience here
- Talk to a professor! No matter which department you're in, there's bound to be folks who need data experience — I've worked in places from sociology to biology.
