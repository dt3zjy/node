### Program Lead
#### Daniel Tohti
Hello everyone! My name is Daniel and I am a second year at UVA majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I'm super pumped to be meeting and working with all of you this semester! I really enjoy working with machine learning and big data sets, and I hope to combine data science and computer science with my passion in aerospace engineering. Outside of my academics, I enjoy cooking all types of food, cruising on my skateboard, and lifting at the gym. Feel free to email me anytime at **daniel.tohti@joinforge.co** with any questions, or just to chat!

### Program Coordinators
#### Evan Rees
Hey everyone. My name is Evan and I am a second year majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. I’m really looking forward to getting to know all of you this semester. Outside of school and Forge, I enjoy swimming, rock climbing, and playing chess (poorly). If you need to reach me for any reason, don’t hesitate to email me at ejr4mhs@virginia.edu

#### Cannon Johns
Hey everyone! I’m Cannon, and I’m a second year statistics/computer science double major. I love working with applied statistics, and using data to make informed decisions, especially within quantitative finance. Also, have a passion for gardening, cooking, running, and listening to indie music. Please email me at **caj7tbz@virginia.edu** if you have any questions about labs or course content.

#### Olivia Mostow
Hi everyone! My name is Olivia and I’m a first year studying physics and statistics. I really enjoy predictive modeling and the statistical analysis side of data science. I hope to apply machine learning and data manipulation to scientific data, possibly in the context of particle accelerators and quantum information. Outside of academics, I spend most of my time cooking/baking, running, and listening to music. Feel free to email me at **mvh6ye@virginia.edu** if you have any questions!
