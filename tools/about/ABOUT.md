### Program Lead
#### Daniel Tohti
Hello everyone! My name is Daniel and I am a second year at UVA majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I'm super pumped to be meeting and working with all of you this semester! I really enjoy working with machine learning and big data sets, and I hope to combine data science and computer science with my passion in aerospace engineering. Outside of my academics, I enjoy cooking all types of food, cruising on my skateboard, and lifting at the gym. Feel free to email me anytime at **daniel.forge@joinforge.co** with any questions, or just to chat!
