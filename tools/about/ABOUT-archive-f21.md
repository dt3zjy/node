### Program Lead
#### Ishaan Dey
Hey there! My name is Ishaan, I'm a fourth year at the University of Virginia studying statistics & economics, and hopefully medicine. The common denominator across my interests: making healthcare work for people. Whether it’s genomic sequences or financial outcomes, I’m interested in leveraging data to make care accessible and affordable. This is my 6th semester at Forge, and fifth teaching in the Node program. Outside of school, I love photography, cooking, and rooting for the Baltimore Ravens. Feel free to reach out with any questions, or just say hi! You can find me by email at **ishaan@joinforge.co** or find more about what I do [here](https://www.ishaandey.com).

### Program Coordinator
#### Daniel Tohti
Hello everyone! My name is Daniel and I am a second year at UVA majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I'm super pumped to be meeting and working with all of you this semester! I really enjoy working with machine learning and big data sets, and I hope to combine data science, computer science with my passion in aerospace engineering. Outside of my academics, I enjoy cooking all types of food, cruising on my skateboard, and lifting at the gym. Feel free to email me anytime at **dt3zjy@virginia.edu** with any questions, or just to chat!
