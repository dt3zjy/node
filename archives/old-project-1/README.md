## Data Ethics
Data science is all around us. It's impossible to avoid. Our clothes are marketed to us based on machine learning predictions. Our TikToks likes are logged on data centers abroad. Unfortunately, data scientists can sometimes live in a bubble. In the pursuit of bigger and better, they easily overlook the real, *human consequences* of AI and data science.

In this project, we'll explore recent episodes in data ethics â€“ everything from improper data collection to racist AI. The issue in some of these are clear-cut, while others are subtler. Your goal: give us a brief. Write an article, make a notebook, maybe even a chalk talk. You'll be the expert, the rest of us are here to listen and learn. This is super casual, a 3 minute summary of the event and its consequences is just about all you'll need.

### Your Task
1. As a team, **research an event** from the list below. If you have another in mind, let us a know!
2. Use the following scaffolding to guide your thoughts: 
     *  *What's wrong?* What was the project, who's a part of it, and what went wrong? 
     *  *How did we get here?* Why did this happen? Financial gain? Lack of oversight? 
     *  *What can we do about it?* What are the next steps? How do we make sure this doesn't happen again? 
3. Put together a **deliverable**! Think a Medium article, slide deck, or little cheatsheet to what's going on. This is super casual, just some thoughts on paper, or bullets on a few slides will do the job. 
4. **Share it with us!** Pop it into the slack when you're done, and be ready to share a **3 minute** summary of what you've learned!

*Deadline is flexible*, but try to have it done by next week (Sunday, Sept 27th).

### Issues to Explore
We'll update this as we go along with group names. The suggested readings just a place to start, like just about everything else in this class, Google will take you a long way.
